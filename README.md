### Project Overview
> Discovered during analysis of legacy storage media, Helium is an early-stage 3D sandbox game engine under active development. While still in prototype phase, the core framework demonstrates promising capabilities for interactive world-building. We invite developers to explore the current build, report issues, and contribute ideas through our discussion forums.

### Current Features
- **Procedural Terrain Generation**: Dynamic landscape creation algorithms
- **Voxel-based Environment**: Destructible/constructible block system
- **Basic Physics Engine**: Gravity and collision detection
- **Cross-platform Rendering**: Experimental Vulkan/OpenGL support
- **Modular Architecture**: Decoupled systems for easy extension

### Planned Features
| Component       | Development Status | Key Functionality                      |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Server**      | Planning           | Multiplayer support, World persistence |
| **Client**      | Design Phase       | UI/UX systems, Enhanced rendering      |
| **Modding API** | Research           | Scriptable entities, Asset pipelines   |
